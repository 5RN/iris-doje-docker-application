# IRIS-DOJE-DOCKER-APPLICATION

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [Docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed.

## Installation 

Clone/git pull the repo into any local directory

```
$ git clone https://github.com/5RN/iris-doje-docker-application.git
```

Open the terminal in this directory and run:

```
$ docker-compose build
```

Run Angular front-end and IRIS backend containers in a single project:

```
$ docker-compose up -d
```

Once the containers are up and running, go to http://localhost:9000 to get to the UI home page


IRIS backend container will provide the REST endpoint to serve the angular frontend.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.3.
